# Frontend Design Skill

Create distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that avoid generic "AI slop" aesthetics. Implement real working code with exceptional attention to aesthetic details and creative choices.

## Design Thinking Process

Before coding, understand context and commit to a **BOLD aesthetic direction**:

### Key Considerations

1. **Purpose**: What problem does this interface solve? Who uses it?

2. **Tone** (pick an extreme):
   - Brutally minimal
   - Maximalist chaos
   - Retro-futuristic
   - Organic/natural
   - Luxury/refined
   - Playful/toy-like
   - Editorial/magazine
   - Brutalist/raw
   - Art deco/geometric
   - Soft/pastel
   - Industrial/utilitarian

3. **Constraints**: Technical requirements (framework, performance, accessibility)

4. **Differentiation**: What makes this UNFORGETTABLE? What's the one thing someone will remember?

### Critical Principle

> Choose a clear conceptual direction and execute it with precision. Bold maximalism and refined minimalism both work—the key is **intentionality, not intensity**.

## Implementation Requirements

Code must be:
- Production-grade and functional
- Visually striking and memorable
- Cohesive with a clear aesthetic point-of-view
- Meticulously refined in every detail

## Frontend Aesthetics Guidelines

### Typography

- Choose fonts that are **beautiful, unique, and interesting**
- **Avoid:** Generic fonts like Arial, Inter, Roboto, system fonts
- **Prefer:** Distinctive, characterful font choices that elevate aesthetics
- **Pattern:** Pair a distinctive display font with a refined body font

### Color & Theme

- Commit to a cohesive aesthetic
- Use CSS variables for consistency
- **Strategy:** Dominant colors with sharp accents outperform timid, evenly-distributed palettes

### Motion

- Use animations for effects and micro-interactions
- **HTML:** Prioritize CSS-only solutions
- **React:** Use Motion library (Framer Motion) when available
- **Strategy:** One well-orchestrated page load with staggered reveals (animation-delay) creates more delight than scattered micro-interactions
- Include scroll-triggering and hover states that surprise

### Spatial Composition

- Unexpected layouts
- Asymmetry and overlap
- Diagonal flow
- Grid-breaking elements
- Generous negative space OR controlled density

### Backgrounds & Visual Details

Create atmosphere and depth rather than defaulting to solid colors:
- Gradient meshes
- Noise textures
- Geometric patterns
- Layered transparencies
- Dramatic shadows
- Decorative borders
- Custom cursors
- Grain overlays

## What NOT to Do

### Avoid Generic AI Aesthetics

- Overused font families (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts)
- Clichéd color schemes (especially purple gradients on white)
- Predictable layouts and component patterns
- Cookie-cutter design lacking context-specific character

### Anti-Pattern

> NEVER converge on common choices across generations. Vary between light/dark themes, different fonts, different aesthetics.

## Design Execution Principle

> **IMPORTANT:** Match implementation complexity to the aesthetic vision.
> - **Maximalist designs** need elaborate code with extensive animations and effects
> - **Minimalist/refined designs** need restraint, precision, and careful attention to spacing, typography, and subtle details
> - **Elegance comes from executing the vision well**

## Core Philosophy

> Remember: Claude is capable of extraordinary creative work. **Don't hold back, show what can truly be created when thinking outside the box and committing fully to a distinctive vision.**
